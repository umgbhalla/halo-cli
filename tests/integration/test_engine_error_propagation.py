"""Engine error propagation: SDK failures must surface through the bus, not deadlock.

Two pathways the runner-level unit tests can't see:

1. Non-retriable SDK error → ``stream_engine_async``'s consumer must observe the
   real exception, not block forever waiting for events on a never-closed bus.
2. Retriable-error exhaustion → ``EngineAgentExhaustedError`` propagates
   through the engine boundary, not just through ``OpenAiAgentRunner.run``.

A ``TimeoutError`` from ``run_with_fake`` is the deadlock signal — the bus
was never closed on the error path.

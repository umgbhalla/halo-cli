"""HALO Deno+Pyodide WASM sandbox.

One ``Sandbox`` class owns the host-side surface: discovery, asset prep,
the Deno argv, and ``run_python``. A private ``_RunnerSession`` owns one
subprocess + JSON-RPC roundtrip. Pyodide-specific knobs (version pin,
required packages, lockfile-driven wheel resolution) live as module
constants and helpers in this same file.

The single per-process knob (``_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``) is a module constant
rather than a config field. Production runs all want the same wall-clock
budget; the one test that needs a different value monkeypatches the
constant directly.
